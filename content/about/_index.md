Kingman Odd Fellows Lodge No. 8 was chartered in 2019 by the Grand Lodge of Arizona, but the history of the Odd Fellows in Kingman goes back more than 100 years. From nine members at the 2019 reopening, Kingmanâ€™s lodge has steadily grown and together work to improve and uplift the community. Recent outreach includes seasonal raffles, giving for the relief of the sick and distressed, and attempts to preserve or improve local monuments. Those interested in working with fellow community members in a positive and orderly manner are encouraged to approach the lodge for membership. Lodge meetings are held at 2:30 p.m. on the first and third Saturdays of each month at 212 North 4th St, Kingman, AZ 86401.
